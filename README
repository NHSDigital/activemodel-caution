=== Warnings for ActiveModel

The activemodel-caution gem mirrors ActiveModel's validation framework to provide non-blocking warnings.
It is possible to specify a warning as 'active', in which case it must be confirmed (otherwise a
validation error is raised).

== Installation / Usage

To build a new version of the gem:
* Ensure that you have updated `VERSION` and/or `RAILS_VERSION` in lib/active_model/cautions/version.rb;
* Run `gem build activemodel-caution.gemspec` to create a .gem file;
* Run `gem install ./activemodel-caution-x.y.z.gem` to install the .gem you just built.

You can then use `bundle install` as usual, and it will find the installed gem.

== Testing

Development dependencies can be installed using bundler: `bundler install`.
Tests can be run with `bundle exec rake`.
They currently use an in-memory SQLite database, for testing the ActiveRecord integration.
Please be aware we currently need to support both 1.8.7 and 1.9.3.
